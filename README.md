HI GUYS !!

Here a guide to help you on :
- how to install and launch my portfolio project
- how did I deploy my project
- the actions implemented in the repository


So, we'll start with how to install and launch my portfolio project :

If you are here, it must mean that you actually are in my repo or you can access it with this link below :
https://github.com/Elyn03/celine-portfolio
The steps are :
- click on the "Code" button
- click "Download ZIP"


Then, we'll see how I deploy my project :
For the deployement, I choose Vercel, a cloud platform where we can deploy our project through Git repository.
Here are the steps for my deployement :
- create a account on Vercel.com
- connect my github account with vercel
- chose the repository for the deployement 



Finally, what are the actions implemented in my repository :
I choose to activate 2 apps from the marketplace :
- the first one is "Imgbot" because it helps to optimize all the images thats are present in the project  
- the second one is "CodeFactor" because it ensures that my code meets with the quality standards with a review that takes only few seconds
